2. Data Processing layers and details of each

Data is processed in following layers in all Opco's.
- CDR/ODS: Meadiated (readable/parsed) CDRs are recieved from Mediation (CSG) & loaded in BI tables with some BI DWH Keys like Service Class Key, Service Usage Key (Voice/SMS/Data) etc. No aggregation or data transformation is done at this layer. Schema/Folder for all these tables is DWH_CDR_REPOSITORY_MOBILITY_<OPCO_CODE> e.g. DWH_CDR_REPOSITORY_MOBILITY_KE

- Summary Layer: Source wise aggregation is done at this level. Data is kept at MSISDN level at this layer. Schema/Folder for all these tables is DWH_SUMMARY_MOBILITY_<OPCO_CODE> e.g. DWH_SUMMARY_MOBILITY_KE

- Analytical Layer: Source wise aggregation is done at this level. Data is kept at dimension level. MSISDN is removed from this layer. Schema/Folder for all these tables is DWH_ANALYTICAL_MOBILITY_<OPCO_CODE> e.g. DWH_ANALYTICAL_MOBILITY_KE.

- DataMart Layer/ Reporting Layer : Fact Level data, i.e. KPIs required for front end and reporting is populated in Fact Tables at this layer.
Schema/Folder for all these tables is DM_BI_MOBILITY_<OPCO_CODE> e.g. DM_BI_MOBILITY_KE.

- SOR: Transaction level meaningful data derived from CDRs is kept at this layer. Schema/Folder for all these tables is DWH_SOR_<OPCO_CODE>.

- Dimensions : All the dimensions' data is kept in tables at DWH_SOR schema/folder, same is replicated in DM_BI_MOBILITY to be consumed by Cubes/Reports.
